## Changelog

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/poi-plugin-ezexped.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/poi-plugin-ezexped)

### (TODO) 1.0.0

- (TODO) Added Fleet composition requirements related to DE and CVE
- (TODO) More tooltips
- "Great Success" toggle turns golden when it's on
- Improved fleet auto switch mechanism
- Improved requirement checking mechanism

### 0.5.0

- Remove "Allow switching to this plugin automatically"

    - This setting is now handled by main program so we no longer need a redundant one for exactly same purpose.

- Handle expedition result screen action

    - Switch to this plugin when user is on expedition result screen
    - Also focus the related fleet tab if fleet auto-switch is on

- Right clicking on a fleet button will cause main UI to switch to that particular fleet.

- Remove data migration code.

    - If you are updating from 0.4.1 or 0.4.2, nothing should have been changed
    - Otherwise some settings might be reset to their detaults.

### 0.4.2

- Compatibility, no behavior change.

### 0.4.1

- User data migration from localStorage to poi config.

    Nothing should have been changed on the surface.

- Improved fleet Auto Switch logic

    Removing equipments from a fleet member triggers auto switch.

### 0.4.0

- Allow hiding main fleet from tab, disabled by default.

    "Main fleet" is usually your first fleet. But when you have a combined fleet,
    your second fleet is also considered part of it.

- Allow hiding satisfied requirements.

- Auto Switch interacts with "Hide Main Fleet" setting.

    - If all possible fleets are sent out, with "Hide Main Fleet" on, Auto Switch won't try
      to focus your main fleet.

### 0.3.1

- Adding "All ships need to be sparkled" requirement for great success expeditions

    Exceptions are Expedition 21 / 24 / 37 / 38 / 40 (usually referred to as "overdrum expeditions"),
    For non-overdrum expeditions, it's a requirement that all ships in fleet need to be sparkled.
    However, you can have less than 5 ships in a fleet and still get great success
    given that all regular expedition requirements are met.

- Allow customizing "number of sparkled ships" to `3`.

### 0.3.0

- Allow customizing the number of sparkled ships for great success on non-overdruming expeditions
- Now user can opt-in plugin auto-switch feature.

    This feature is turned off by default. When enabled, poi switches to this plugin automatically
    when user goes to the in-game expedition screen.

### 0.2.3

- Fix errors when not all fleets are unlocked in game

### 0.2.2

- Fix errors caused by missing translations

## Features

### Expedition Requirement Checker

Check your fleet against expedition requirements. Now all you have to do
is to take a look at unmet requirements and adjust your fleet & equipments accordingly.

### Accurate Resource Income Estimation

Great Success, all kinds of Daihatsu Landing Craft, their improvement levels
and resupply cost, all taken into account.

### Auto Switch

Always show you the most related fleet depending on your in-game action:

- Automatically switch to the fleet you are working on (changing fleet composition or ship equipments)
- Automatically switch to the fleet you are about to send out for expedition, allows a last minute confirmation.

Note that when all of your fleets are sent out, by default Auto Switch will try to focus your main fleet,
this is intended behavior as your main fleet becomes the only fleet which you can change its composition.
However, this behavior is disabled when "Hide Main Fleet" option is on.

### Colorful Fleet Indicator

The Fleet Indicator allows you to tell whether a fleet is ready for the expedition you have specfied
without even taking a close look at it.

![](docs/indicator1.jpg)

- Green: This fleet is ready for the expedition or you cannot send this fleet out for expedition.
- Blue: This fleet is not available, perhaps due to an on-going expedition.
- Orange: This fleet is almost ready for the expedition, all you have to do is to resupply this fleet and send them out again.
- Red: This fleet has some unmet requirements more than just resupply issue.

Note that these colors may vary depending on your theme.
