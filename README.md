### Auto Switch

Always show you the most related fleet depending on your in-game action:

- Automatically switch to the fleet you are working on (changing fleet composition or ship equipments)
- Automatically switch to the fleet you are about to send out for expedition, allows a last minute confirmation.

### Colorful Fleet Indicator

The Fleet Indicator allows you to tell whether a fleet is ready for the expedition you have specfied
without even taking a close look at it.

![](docs/indicator1.jpg)

- Green: This fleet is ready for the expedition or you cannot send this fleet out for expedition.
- Blue: This fleet is not available, perhaps due to an on-going expedition.
- Orange: This fleet is almost ready for the expedition, all you have to do is to resupply this fleet and send them out again.
- Red: This fleet has some unmet requirements more than just resupply issue.

Note that these colors may vary depending on your theme.
